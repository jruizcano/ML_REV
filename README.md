## Brief Explanation of Project 

This project was made as part of the PPLE Finance Specialist course at IE.

The objective was to increase the amount of loans the company was granting customers, while also attempting to minimize the risk of default. 

We also had to bare in mind that models would have to be **interpretable** since regulations (GDPR Article 22) ensure companies loaning out data can explain why the individual is rejected as to ensure no discrimination. 

As you will be able to find in the jupiter notebooks, we used the following models: **Decision trees, Logistic Regression, XGBoost**. 

In the code, I've added some information as to the thought process behind the methodolgy and steps I took when creating the models. However, for more information, please consult the powerpoint presentation, as this was our deliverable.
